language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, 
functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), 
and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and 
later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO 
(ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages 
designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
