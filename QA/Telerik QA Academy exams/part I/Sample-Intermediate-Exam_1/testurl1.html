Executed usually by different people<br/>

How many testing principles are there?<br/>
 answer: 7 <br/>
1) Testing shows presence of defects: Testing can show the defects are present, but cannot prove that there are no defects. Even after testing the application or product thoroughly we cannot say that the product is 100% defect free. Testing always reduces the number of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness.
<br/>
2) Exhaustive testing is impossible: Testing everything including all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not possible. So, instead of doing the exhaustive testing we can use risks and priorities to focus testing efforts. For example: In an application in one screen there are 15 input fields, each having 5 possible values, then to test all the valid combinations you would need 30  517  578  125  (515) tests. This is very unlikely that the project timescales would allow for this number of tests. So, accessing and managing risk is one of the most important activities and reason for testing in any project.
<br/>
3) Early testing: In the software development life cycle testing activities should start as early as possible and should be focused on defined objectives.
<br/>
4) Defect clustering: A small number of modules contains most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing or shows the most operational failures.
<br/>
5) Pesticide paradox: If the same kinds of tests are repeated again and again, eventually the same set of test cases will no longer be able to find any new bugs. To overcome this “Pesticide Paradox”, it is really very important to review the test cases regularly and new and different tests need to be written to exercise different parts of the software or system to potentially find more defects.
<br/>
6) Testing is context depending: Testing is basically context dependent. Different kinds of sites are tested differently. For example, safety – critical software is tested differently from an e-commerce site.
<br/>
7) Absence – of – errors fallacy: If the system built is unusable and does not fulfil the user’s needs and expectations then finding and fixing defects does not help.
<br/>

Exhaustive testing is<br/>
 answer:
 Testing functionality with all valid, invalid inputs and preconditions
 <br/>
 Important bugs found during the design phase of the product are ..... than those found by the users.<br/>
  answer: easier to fix<br/><br/>
  
  "Most of the bugs are focused in a small subset of the system's modules." <br/>
Which testing principle does this sentence describe?
 answer:
 <br/>
 
 Which of the statements below can be associated with the principle The Pesticide Paradox?<br/>
 answer:
Repeated tests start loosing their effect<br/><br/>

The sentence "You can use the same tests over different applications" is in conflict with the test principle ...<br/>
 answer:
Testing is context dependent<br/><br/>

Absence-of-errors fallacy means that<br/>
 answer:
 If the system built is unusable and does not fulfil the user’s needs and expectations then finding and fixing defects does not help.<br/><br/>

 
 Which of the sentences below are not part of the Fundamental Test Process<br/>
 answer:
 <br/><br/>
Test Planning is final and usually is not revised during the software development<br/>
answer:
False <br/><br/>
 
Test Strategy is defined<br/>
 answer:
During Test Planning <br/><br/>
 
Developing test cases is done during<br/>
 answer:
Test Analysis and Design <br/><br/>

Test Oracle can be a tool. And it can be used to predict the possible release date for the project.<br/>
 answer:
False
 <br/><br/>
Test cases can be logical and concrete. Logical test cases use expected values and concrete use unexpected ones.<br/>
 answer:
False <br/><br/>
 
 
 Test cases are executed during the Test Implementation and Execution phase. During that phase ... .<br/>
 answer:
An appropriate test environment must be set<br/>
 
The set of condition that has to be fulfilled in order to stop the testing activities is called<br/>
 answer: 
 <br/><br/>
One of the test levels is oriented to test separate components of the software. It is called ... testing<br/>
 answer:
Component <br/><br/>
 
"Testing must confirm that all components collaborate correctly". This sentence is a principle in which test level.<br/>
 answer:
Integration Testing 
 <br/><br/>
What should we set when we start System Testing?<br/>
 answer:
Hardware, Software, External devices etc.
<br/><br/>

Which of the test levels is oriented to the client's point of view?<br/>
 answer:
Acceptance Testing<br/><br/>
 
 
Beta Testing is done at the customer's side<br/>
 answer:
True <br/><br/>
 
The Prioritization of tests is done by evaluating the damage event can cause if realized. This also known as<br/>
 answer:
Risk-based Testing  
 <br/><br/>
Functional requirements are used as a basis when ... is done.<br/>
 answer: 
 <br/><br/>
 Non-functional testing can be<br/>
 answer:
<br/><br/>
Regression Testing is<br/>
 answer:
Verifying existing functional and non functional area after making changes to the part of the software or addition of new features.
<br/><br/>
As causes of incidents we may point<br/>
 answer:
<br/><br/>

What are the mandatory things that should be included in an incident report?<br/>
 answer:
<br/><br/>
The severity of the incident defines its impact on the system while the priority determines how quickly the bug should be fixed.<br/>
 answer:
True<br/><br/>
 
 A defect can be in the following stages during its lifecycle<br/>
 answer:
Opened, Closed, Tested <br/><br/>

Increment and iteration are basically synonyms.<br/>
 answer:
False<br/><br/>

 answer:
True <br/><br/>

Unit tests are usually done by<br/>
 answer:
The developer <br/><br/>

 answer:<br/><br/>

There are two types of risk that have to be considered during testing in order to prioritize the tests - product and ... risk.<br/>
 answer:<br/><br/>

Which of the below mentioned risks are Product Risks?<br/>
