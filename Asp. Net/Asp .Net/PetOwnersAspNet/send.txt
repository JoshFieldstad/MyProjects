Dear Infragistics interview panel,
I am sending You the Asp .Net task on time - as we agreed. Working on this project was fun and honestly sometimes challenging, no matter it is so simple once You learn the basic Asp idea and technology. Despite the hard work I consider this to be an opportunity to develop my skills and 'go forward'.   Once again I want to Thank You all, for the time and efforts spent. In the Project documentation (Project folder) on the second page there is a described user interaction scenario (at least the way I use the application services). Just to be fair, I will allow myself to add a final note: from the six days project developing time that You've gave me, I had the chance to work no more than 3-4 days. So I truly hope You wont be disappointed...very much.

Best regards,
E.Kostadinov.
